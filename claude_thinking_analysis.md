# Claude Code Router and Thinking Sections Analysis

## Understanding Claude's Thinking Sections

### What Are Thinking Sections?

Claude's "thinking" sections (also called reasoning content blocks or extended thinking) represent Claude's internal reasoning process that occurs before generating the final response. These sections appear as grey text in the Claude Code extension and other interfaces when the extended thinking feature is enabled.

### Origin of Thinking Tokens/Content Blocks

According to Anthropic's documentation:
- **API Structure**: When extended thinking is enabled, Claude's API response includes structured content blocks:
  - First: "thinking" content blocks that show Claude's internal reasoning process
  - Then: "text" content blocks that contain the final response
- **Mechanism**: These are not just additional text - they're specific content block types in the API response format
- **Model Versions**: Supported in Claude 3.7 and Claude 4 models
- **Purpose**: Allows transparency into Claude's reasoning process before delivering the final answer

### How Claude Code Router Handles Thinking Content

From the available documentation and research:
- **Router Functionality**: Claude Code Router acts as an intermediary that forwards requests to Claude API and routes responses
- **Content Preservation**: When thinking content blocks are present in Claude API responses, the router should preserve and forward these blocks appropriately
- **Extension Display**: The VS Code Claude Code extension interprets these content blocks and renders them differently (grey text) to distinguish reasoning from final answers

### Comparison with Other Models Like Gemini Pro

#### Gemini Pro's Reasoning Capabilities

Google's Gemini models have similar functionality through:
- **"Thinking" Models**: Gemini 2.5 series supports thinking features
- **Structure**: Similar to Claude's approach, these models can provide reasoning steps before final answers
- **API Integration**: Available through the standard Gemini API with specific parameter settings
- **Documentation**: Google provides guidance on enabling and using these reasoning capabilities

#### Key Differences

1. **Implementation Format**:
   - Claude: Uses distinct "thinking" and "text" content blocks in the Messages API
   - Gemini: Has integrated reasoning features that work similarly but with different API structures

2. **Interface Display**:
   - Claude: Explicit grey text display in Claude Code extension for thinking sections
   - Gemini: Generally doesn't have the same explicit visual distinction in most interfaces

3. **Enablement**:
   - Claude: Requires specific API parameters to enable extended thinking
   - Gemini: Also requires specific settings to enable reasoning capabilities

### Technical Considerations for Implementation

For a Claude Code Router or similar proxy to properly handle Claude-style thinking sections with other models:

1. **API Response Parsing**: Must correctly identify and handle content block types in API responses
2. **Content Block Processing**: Need to properly parse "thinking" vs "text" content blocks
3. **Interface Compatibility**: If the target interface supports it, maintain the visual distinction
4. **Parameter Handling**: Properly set API parameters to enable reasoning capabilities
5. **Cross-Model Compatibility**: Ensure that thinking sections from different providers can be handled consistently

### Conclusion

The thinking sections that appear as grey text in Claude Code are specifically tied to Claude's API design where it sends structured content blocks representing internal reasoning. While other models like Gemini Pro have similar reasoning capabilities, they don't necessarily provide the same structured content block format or visual representation in interfaces. A Claude Code Router or similar system would need to understand the specific content block structure of each model provider to properly handle and display reasoning content.

For implementation purposes, Claude Code Router would need to:
1. Recognize thinking content blocks in Claude API responses
2. Forward them appropriately to compatible frontends
3. Handle equivalent reasoning structures from other providers like Gemini
4. Maintain compatibility with different UI frameworks that might interpret these differently
