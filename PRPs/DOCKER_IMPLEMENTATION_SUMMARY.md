# Docker Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the Docker containerization implementation for the CCR Qwen Bridge project. The implementation enables continuous deployment of the bridge on any machine while maintaining persistent access to Qwen OAuth credentials.

## Files Created

1. **Dockerfile** - Multi-stage Docker build with security best practices
2. **docker-compose.yml** - Docker Compose configuration for easy deployment
3. **.dockerignore** - Optimized build context exclusion patterns
4. **healthcheck.js** - Container health check script
5. **test/docker.test.js** - Docker deployment validation tests
6. **PRPs/docker-containerization.md** - Comprehensive PRP for Docker implementation

## Key Features

### Security
- Multi-stage build for minimal image size
- Non-root user execution (nodejs:nodejs)
- Proper file permissions and ownership
- Latest security updates from base images

### Credential Persistence
- Named volume for persistent credential storage
- Volume mapping from host `~/.qwen` to container `/home/node/.qwen`
- Automatic access to existing Qwen credentials

### Configuration Management
- Full environment variable support for all bridge configuration options
- Default values aligned with existing configuration
- Flexible deployment across different environments

### Process Management
- Proper signal handling for graceful shutdowns
- Health check endpoint monitoring
- Automatic restart policy (unless-stopped)

## Deployment Options

### Quick Start with Docker Compose
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Manual Docker Commands
```bash
docker build -t ccr-qwen-bridge .
docker run -d \
  --name qwen-bridge \
  -p 31337:31337 \
  -v qwen-credentials:/home/node/.qwen \
  -e HOST=0.0.0.0 \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  ccr-qwen-bridge
```

## Validation

All Docker components have been validated:
- ✅ Dockerfile builds successfully
- ✅ docker-compose.yml configuration is valid
- ✅ Health check script functions correctly
- ✅ Docker deployment tests pass
- ✅ Multi-stage build creates minimal image

## Integration

The Docker implementation has been integrated with existing documentation:
- Updated DEPLOYMENT.md with comprehensive Docker deployment instructions
- Maintained compatibility with existing configuration patterns
- Preserved all existing functionality while adding containerization benefits

## Benefits

1. **Portability** - Run on any system with Docker
2. **Isolation** - Process and dependency isolation
3. **Persistence** - Credential file access maintained
4. **Simplicity** - One-command deployment with Docker Compose
5. **Reliability** - Automatic restarts and health monitoring
6. **Security** - Non-root execution and minimal attack surface
